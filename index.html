        <p class="first">Welcome to my portfolio website. My name is Carl Lombardi and I am an aspiring full-stack developer, aiming to bring a fresh perspective to the industry. I began my career in the insurance field, working over nine years at American International Group in the Excess Casualty Claims department. After departing from AIG, I have decided to make a career change into development.</p>
        <p>I have recently graduated from Rutgers Full Stack Development Bootcamp and am ready for my next challenge. I am a 2009 graduate of Fairfield University in Fairfield, CT, with a B.A. in English/Journalism. I spent the summers of 2005 and 2006 as a play-by-play and color commentator for the Bridgeport Bluefish of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball on WVOF. In 2006, I was a member of the broadcast team for the 2006 ALPB All Star Game from the Ballpark at Harbor Yard in Bridgeport, CT.</p>

        <h3 id="design">Design Philosophy</h3>
        <p id="designp">When it comes to my personal design philosophy, my main goal is to "do more with less".
        I believe the best websites feature a clean UI which allows even non-technical people to be comfortable and conduct business. </p>

        <div class="techdiv">
        <h3 id="tech">Technology Skills</h3>
        <p id="techp"> I have gained experience with JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Node.js, jQuery, MySQL, MongoDB, Github, Bootstrap, AJAX, JSON, REST,
            React.js, APIs, Heroku, Firebase, ReactJS., Microsoft Suite, Git</p>
        </div>
        <div class="skillsdiv">
        <h3 id="skills">People Skills</h3>
        <p id="skillsp">Beyond the hard technology skills and design philosophy developed during Bootcamp, my general approach is people first. Whether I am working as part of a team in a business or on my own, I believe in bringing a postive, hard-working attitude to any job or task. </p>
